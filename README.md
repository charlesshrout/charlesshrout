GAMING REVIEWS WITH CHUCK

Project Pitch: A react web page that lets the user sort through multiple reviews of games (reviewed by me). The review will provide ample information such as a pros/cons section, what platforms the game is available on, where to find the game for the lowest price, and the ability to mark the game as played or not. The user will also have the ability to submit a new review of a game.

As a user, I can:
- Search genres of games or a specific game by name
- I can select whether I have played the game or not
- Click on a specific review and see a pros/cons section and the cheapest price of that game 
- Submit a new review for a game and see it appear on the game review list
